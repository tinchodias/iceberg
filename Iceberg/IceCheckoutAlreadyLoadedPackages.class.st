I'm a strategy thet will load into image JUST the packages that were already loaded on it. 
Loading same-named packages of those already in image is probably the best strategy possible before an installation following a project description.

This strategy is still dangerous bacause packages installed may be incorrectly initialisated. Or a refactor could have split a package and now half of the data are not there anymore. But still... is the best possible approach when you do not have a propper project description.
