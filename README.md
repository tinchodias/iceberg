# Iceberg

Iceberg is the main toolset for handling [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) in Pharo.

[![Iceberg-Pharo-Integration](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg/actions/workflows/test-all.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg/actions/workflows/test-all.yml)  
[![Complete Test](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg/actions/workflows/test.yml)

More concretely, Iceberg provides tools to checkout, commit, merge and other common operations in git repositories, all directly from the image.
In fact, git is currently the only VCS backend for Iceberg, but it's design supports the addition of other options.

Iceberg also provides some plugins for smooth and fast integration with common actions in the workflow of contributors, such as creating a branch based on a GitHub issue number.
